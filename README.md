# PCA-Based-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement
An implementation of the paper: N. Singh and A. K. Bhandari, "Principal Component Analysis-Based Low-Light Image Enhancement Using Reflection Model," in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, vol. 70, pp. 1-10, 2021, Art no. 5012710, doi: 10.1109/TIM.2021.3096266.
Results from the proposed Low light image enhancement technique has been compared with other standard methods in literature such as histogram equalization, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), Dark Channel Prior (DCP), Fast efficient algorithm (FEA) and Multi-Scale Retinex methods.
Ideal test images include those from low light image dataset and retina fundus dataset available publicly. 
The comparison metrics include FSIM, PCQI, VSI, Entropy, SSIM, NIQE
